# Movie_recommendation_system

With millions or even billions of items available on entertainment platforms and online stores, it can be overwhelming for customers to choose the right one. This is where recommender systems play a crucial role, helping users discover the most relevant items by narrowing down their options.

Recommendation systems have become an integral part of machine learning, offering significant advantages to tech giants like Netflix, Amazon, and others by tailoring content for specific audiences. These systems are highly accurate in their predictions, dynamically adapting the user interface based on real-time interactions to enhance user engagement.

The business objectives for this project are:

To develop a Collaborative Filtering-based Movie Recommendation System.
Predict the ratings a user would assign to movies they have not yet rated.
Minimize the error between predicted and actual ratings, using metrics like RMSE and MAPE.
